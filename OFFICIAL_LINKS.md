# Official links

When sharing Advanchat with others (i.e., messages, internet posts, video descriptions, etc.), please do not use the direct download link or any user-generated link to the add-on. Instead, use one of the following official links:
- https://mcpedl.com/advanchat
- https://curseforge.com/minecraft-bedrock/addons/advanchat
- https://github.com/th3emilis/advanchat

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Opting to use one of the links above helps support me and ensures players who want to download the add-on will always have access to the latest version.**
