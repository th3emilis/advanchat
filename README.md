# Advanchat

*Created by [Th3Emilis](https://github.com/th3emilis)*

Advanchat aims to improve the experience of touch players when using the chat screen by implementing useful features such as autocompletion abilities only available to keyboard players up until now.

## Features

Advanchat simplifies the chat screen experience of touch players with small but useful features like tab buttons to autocomplete your commands or arrow buttons to let you navigate between your previous messages and send them again.

Other features include UI fixes, such as proper focus state effect for buttons, and the ability to prevent the chat screen from closing when taking damage.

Some features are only available by enabling the extension packs bundled with the base add-on. If you do not plan to use any of the additional features, simply delete the extension packs. If you change your mind, reinstall the add-on to recover them.
